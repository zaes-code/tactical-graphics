 * # Drawn anchor points ⇄ the frame a point-anchored generator wants
 *
 * APP-06 defines most of the maneuver symbols from **drawn points**: "point 1 defines
 * the beginning of the straight line, point 2 the end, point 3 the diameter". This
 * library grew them the other way round — a dropped center plus a `size` and a
 * `rotation` — so the symbols are right but the user cannot set their proportions.
 *
 * Rather than rewrite eight pieces of geometry, this converts between the two. A
 * generator keeps the shape maths it already has and asks for its frame here; the
 * frame is derived from what the user drew instead of from a center and a scalar.
 *
 * **The angle convention is the generators', not turf's.** `angle` is planar radians
 * counter-clockwise from **east**, which is what `geometryService.translateCoordinates`
 * takes. Turf speaks degrees clockwise from north, so the two are `90 - deg` apart and
 * getting it backwards mirrors every symbol about its own axis.
